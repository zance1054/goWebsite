# Hello_World.go my name is Alec

Well, here we are. I've sold out. 

Historically I've been pretty much completely against increasing my online presence. In the past social media just hasn't been healthy for me, but I'm have a change of heart... partially. I've been finding difficulting thinking about all of the projects I've done and experience's I've had. So the idea is I'll write about them, and hopefully appreciate them more and remember them more easily! This is my first step out of the comfort zone into the judgement of, whoever managees to find this page I suppose. 

I really want this site to show everything I can do. I am in no means ad front end developer. But I do want this deployed to AWS, GCP, Azure, and my own personal unraid server. I'd also like to throw in some easter eggs into some of my favorite APIs, like the Random.org API and Dungeons and Dragons API. I'm also writing in go since, I havent done work before in go so it will be a fun challenge working through the syntax. 

So who am I, a dev? A cloud engineer? Your friendly neighboor spider-man? You go ahead and pick, I'm just along for the ride.
