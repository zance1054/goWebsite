# Measure twice, cut once. 

I feel like the hardest thing about this project is focusing on one piece at a time. At this point I've sunk a decent amount of time into the front end of this site, and while I know thats important, its not the main thing I set out to do with this. The site is a product to deliver, but the delivery mechanisms is what I really want to be working on i.e. terraform, ansible, helm chart, etc. So I've caught mysleft jumpinmg ahead and investigating how to get terrraform working so I can deploy a VM to my unraid server, which is a whole rabbit hole. I just need to focus on one thing at a time. Get the deliverable finished and hosted so you can take advantage of the site, then work on the other things. Not what I want in this moment, but its necessary

Thats all for now,
